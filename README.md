##**Emergency Dispatch Conversation with AI Feedback**

## **Project Overview**
Laerdal's mission of "helping save lives" inspired this project, which focuses on enhancing emergency dispatcher training through an AI-powered simulator. Dispatchers face immense pressure to make life-saving decisions during emergencies. This Conversational AI prototype acts as a simulator to rehearse critical scenarios and provide evidence-based feedback, helping improve their skills and preparedness.

## **Inspiration**
The idea stemmed from the recognition of the pivotal role dispatchers play in emergency response. Unfortunately, many dispatchers lack up-to-date training or resources based on the latest evidence-based practices. By leveraging the power of AI, we aimed to create a tool that improves dispatcher preparedness while circumventing regulatory hurdles associated with real-time AI in emergency calls.

## **What We Learned**
- The importance of designing user-friendly interfaces for critical tools used in high-stress scenarios.
- The challenges of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI systems in life-saving situations.
- How multilingual and audio playback features enhance accessibility and usability for diverse user groups.

## **How We Built the Project**
1. **Technologies Used:**
   - **Gemini API**: For powering the custom Large Language Model (LLM) functionalities.
   - **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly deployment platform.
   - **Python & VS Code**: For coding and development.
   - **Multilingual and Audio Playback**: Integrated to support diverse users and enhance training experiences.

2. **Key Features:**
   - **Scenario Rehearsals**: Simulate life-threatening emergency scenarios.
   - **Real-Time Feedback**: Highlight evidence-based practices and areas for improvement.
   - **Conversation Transcription**: Analyze and process dispatcher responses with high accuracy.
   - **Multilingual Support**: Ensure inclusivity and accessibility.
   - **Audio Playback**: Recreate real-life call scenarios for an immersive experience.

3. **Deployment and Collaboration:**
   - The project was deployed using **Streamlit**, offering a sleek interface and seamless user experience.
   - Codebase and project documentation were uploaded to **GitHub**, enabling collaboration and future enhancements.

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Accuracy and Safety**: Ensuring the AI provides accurate and contextually appropriate advice in simulated scenarios was critical.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Designing the system to serve as a training simulator rather than a real-time assistant helped avoid liability and regulatory concerns.
- **Multilingual Implementation**: Supporting multiple languages required careful handling of language models and audio playback features.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the potential of AI in improving emergency response training. By simulating real-life scenarios, dispatchers can refine their skills, ultimately saving more lives. The integration of cutting-edge AI with an accessible, user-focused interface makes this tool a game-changer in dispatcher education and preparedness.
